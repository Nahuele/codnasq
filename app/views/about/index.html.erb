          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">CoDNaS-Q <em>—Conformational Diversity of Native State-Quaternary—</em> is a
            high confidence database of conformational diversity in proteins that present a biologically relevant
            quaternary structure.</p>
          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">CoDNaS Quaternary possess a collection of redundant complexes experimentally
            determined by X-Ray crystallography technique, including their experimental conditions (ligands, pH,
            temperature, etc), general information (PDB ID, length, etc), cross linked data with other databases
            (<a name="" href="https://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a> and
            <a name="" href="https://pfam.xfam.org/">Pfam</a>) and structural information of the protein (RMSD,
            oligomeric state, conformers, etc).</p></div>
        <div style=""><h1 class="title">What is it used for?</h1>
          <h1 class="subtitle">Experimental conditions associated to conformational diversity. Applications,
            implementation</h1>
          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">The database allows the user find through different criteria and filters
            proteins in several conformations, taking into account their biological quaternary structure.The different
            redundant structures (conformers) have been structurally aligned all vs all in order to assess the
            conformational variability for a given protein. Additionally, the experimental conditions associated to each
            structure have been considered to allow users associate protein conformational changes with the biological
            function.</p></div>
        <div style=""><h1 class="title">Database implementation</h1>
          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">CoDNaS Quaternary uses homoligomeric proteins annotated by the algorithm
            QSbio (Dey et al. 2018), that combines PISA (Krissinel and Henrick 2007), EPPIC (Duarte et al. 2012) and
            QSalign (Dey et al. 2018), to predict different parameters of protein complexes. Using the BlastClust, all
            the different structures (in the same oligomeric state) deposited for a given protein were obtained. These
            structures are considered as putative conformers and provide snapshots of proteins dynamics. Structural
            alignments among each pair of conformeros for a given protein were performed by TopMatch. The maximum RMSD
            between pair of conformers is a measure of the protein conformational diversity.</p></div>
        <div class="has-margin-b-7" style=""><h1 class="title">Example</h1>
          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">The fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a key regulatory enzyme of
            gluconeogenic pathway. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and
            phosphate.
            This tetrameric enzyme presents two conformational states: R state, in which the enzyme is active and
            bounded with the substrate or product; and the T form, where the enzyme is bound to AMP in presence or
            absence of metallic ions.</p>

          <p class="has-margin-b-7" name="">R and T state of FBPase. 1RDX conformer in gold colour and 1RDY showed in
            cian.</p>
          <p name="">In CoDNaS-Q we are able to find the R and T forms within the
            <a name="" href="/cluster/show/CQ1fpf">CQ1fpf</a> cluster, and 66 others conformers of this protein, some of
            them with the ligand bound. The maximum quaternary RMSD measured for this cluster is 3.38 Å.</p></div>
