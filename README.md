CoDNaS Quaternary is a high confidence database of conformational diversity in proteins that present a biologically relevant quaternary structure.

According PISA about 75% of oligomeric proteins are homoligomers.

CoDNaS Quaternary possess a collection of redundant complexes experimentally determined by X-ray crystallography technique, including their experimental conditions (ligands, pH, temperature, etc.), structure information (PDB ID, length, etc.), cross linked data with other databases (UniProt, Pfam) and structural information of the protein (RMSD, oligomeric state, conformers, etc).
